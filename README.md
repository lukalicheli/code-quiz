# code-quiz
# First created HTML file
# Created a basic CSS file to style the quiz
# Created query selectors to be able to manipulate later
# Made a timer function to decremenet the time by 1. 75 Seconds total
# Made all question and answer object
# Made event listeners to go to next question with each answer and also to display the questions after the start button is clicked.


# Problems: 
# 1. The timer keeps running after game is complete. 
# 2. Doesn't display high score at the end.
# 3. Did not include a ten second penalty with each wrong answer.
# 4. Can't restart game after hitting Start. 
# 5. Start button isn't disabled while game is going
